# KiCAD Symbols & Footprints

This is my collection of KiCAD Printed Circuit Board (PCB) symbols and footprints that either do no exist, or were flawed and needed to be corrected.

## Instructions:

1. Clone this repo into a chosen directory
2. Add the directory plus the library file to the project's symbol library configuration, the steps are:

* In Project window --> Preferences --> Manage Symbols Library
* Hit the "+" button
* Scroll to the bottom of the page
* Add the pull path to the file TC4056A.lib, or whichever lib it is that you want to include in your KiCAD project

# Component Symbols 

## TC4056A LiPo Battery charger IC

More to come, I am sure...
